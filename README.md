# Online Cv
***
Publish your CV using surge.sh without any price

# Getting Started
***
This project contains informations about how can deploy your cv without any payment of templates,domains or server.

# Prerequisites
***
Firstly, we need a template for our cv and I used this [template](https://uicookies.com/downloads/online-cv-html-responsive-bootstrap-resume-template/) with *Free* option. 

Secondly, after click the link, download template and change necessary things with yours.

Lastly, we need a server to deploy our CV and domain. Our CV's is a static page so we can  use [surge.sh](https://surge.sh/) because this platform provides us to deploying unlimited static pages and use custom domains.

# Installing & Running & Deployment
***
Install [surge](https://surge.sh/) using npm with this command 
```bash
npm install --global surge
```
After editing template, use *surge* to deploy your CV
```bash
surge
```
If you do not have a surge account, login your with e-mail address then create your password and enter your project path. You can also deploy again your CV with same domain after editting CV.
